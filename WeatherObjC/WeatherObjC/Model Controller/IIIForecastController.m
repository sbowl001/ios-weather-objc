//Create a function that will perform a data task to get the forecasts. This should take in a zip code, and have a completion block with an error. The process should be the same as if you were writing this in Swift up to the point where you would use a JSONDecoder. Instead, use NSJSONSerialization to turn the data returned from the data task into a dictionary. From there, you will be able to parse it to the point where you can pass a sub-dictionary to your model's initializer.
